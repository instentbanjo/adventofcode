Hello Im instentbanjo :)

This project should represent my repetoir of programming languages I learned to use. 
For this I started doing previous AdventOfCode's foreach language. 

So far I've "decided" to have these:

- 2015: C# 
  - Was my first language I learnt in my Apprenticeship
  - Its a love-hate
  - I do not like Microsoft
- 2016: JavaScript
  - Was my second language I learnt in my Apprenticeship
  - 
- 2017: Python
  - Was my third language I learnt in my Apprenticeship
  - Was my first language I ever touched
- 2018: Go
  - Not shure if it was my fourth language or not I learnt in my Apprenticeship
  - I currently just really like Go

---

## The Order
- C#
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Web-basics, not programming languages but)
- (Powershell?) (idk too long ago)
- SQL (hate it, not a programming language, but hate it)
- PHP (idk so much about it, just that it's the default bad example for web-security)
- JavaScript (more in depth as a language for 'functional programming', ReactJS, expressJS, d3.js, turf.js)
- Python [microbit game](https://github.com/instentbanjo/microbit-parkour-game)
- Go (I could decide what language I use for a project, DO NOT REGRET CHOOSING GO)
